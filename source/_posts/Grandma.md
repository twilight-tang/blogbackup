*by 张照芹*

It never occurred to me
That nothing but memories left.
The broken wicker laundry basket,
And the cane rocking chair with a hole in the seat
Still lie there.

Now she only shows up in my dreams,
Standing by the well,
Which was echoing all the time.
The water in the vet,
Reflected the shadow of her,
Waving her hands,
Slowly and smilingly,
Same as the day I left last time,
And also the last time
