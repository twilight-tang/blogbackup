This is for you, daddy
Wrapped with the gold paper
A box that flared your anger
“Cause we are poor
Little bread have we tasted
No paper shall be wasted”

This is for you, daddy
Hanging on the Christmas tree
A box that damped your glee
“When you give gifts
They are expected to hide
One thing or two inside”

This is for you, daddy
Sitting still on your headstock
A box that made you choke
“I have blew kisses
Into this golden container
Forget me not forever”
