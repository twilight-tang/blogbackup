*by 郑雪拥*

You dance on the stage of your own pride,
I stand in the darkness of my silent mind.
I would even use out all my limited life,
to gaze, gaze, gaze,
till I turn into sculpture or dust along with the stream of time.

But when I could no longer cope,
The endless rolling dice.
I pick up the unwithered lilies of years on the only light side.
Do you see the petals of wind?
Please look into my eyes,
before the last petal fall to die.
