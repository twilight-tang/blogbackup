*by 康含悦*

Wrapped up by glass
Flow quietly at the windless night
It is the colorful sand
That cut apart the time

She is a merciless judge
Sentenced my childhood to yesterday
My youth to passing by
And my tomorrow to cold tomb

Who gave my time to sandglass
My fate was no longer in my hands
Can not plug the crevice
Until the sand is gone
So am I
