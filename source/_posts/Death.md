*by 张紫洁Amor*

The only thing just
That is the death
May be mighty and dreadful
May be splendid and beautiful

The angle smile
The devil disguise
That’s the distance of the death

To the heaven
To the hell
That hinges on thy before

When breathe comes into air
When body goes into dust
All the world steps into fair
