*by Thea*

In the castle
lives a widow
beside the window
sitting in shadow
sinking in sadness
falling in darkness
Lover, lover, where are you
Only echo goes around

Once they were a couple
living in the big castle
singing in the sitting hall
dancing in the small ball
Once they were a couple
Now only a single
Time, time, where you go
Only echo goes aroud
