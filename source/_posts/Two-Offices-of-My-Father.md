*by 郑丹*

In summer, 
there is a stretch of green paddy fields 
in front of my house.
I see a man bending over 
and pulling the weeds.
His bare back is tanned with peeling,
his dark face looks tired with sweat.
The ground is his outdoor office.

In winter,
There is a row of small house 
on the mountainside.
I image a man standing at the table 
and making fireworks.
His large hands are cracked and cold,
his thin body is a little shivering.
The building is his internal office.

Why does he have two offices?
It is because he needs to make a comfortable living for the whole family.
It is because he needs to make a comfortable living for the whole family.
