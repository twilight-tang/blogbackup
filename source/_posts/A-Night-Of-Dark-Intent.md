*by vcvc*

The peaceful water bred danger
Slow ripples looked over a quarrel
And thought of doing something evil
It was a night of dark intent
The sky is high
Moon lighted up the sky
Stars inseted in the milky way
Sparkling the heaven

The quarrel continued
The waves riggled as the voices went high
Ready for something coming
It was a night of dark intent
A sudden salm on the water
Made the evil revealed
Woman cried and man shouted
Boy in the water, mocking
The clouds started to stir

Soon dark clouds consumed the moon
Dark water swallowed the boy
He left the surface and went under
He looked up the sky
Eyesight filled with dark
And then filled with void
It was a night of dark intent
Clouds unfolded
Slow ripples flowed
As nothing ever happened
Except with a body floating
