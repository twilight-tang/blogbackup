*by 吕嘉诚*

All leaves turn towards the sun.
All plants die.
If kept in the shadow too long,
Why should we be different?

You are insistent as the wild poppies,
Born from churned earth,
Given birth from chaos,

Blooming red, or pink, or mauve,
Stem stood proud,
Colour loud.

Don’t hide in the dark
All your life,
Stretch for the sun
And learn to thrive.
