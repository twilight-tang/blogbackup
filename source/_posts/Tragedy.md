*by 李忆*

I’m a murderer going punished,
For killing myself years ago.
My soul wanders from body,
Remains floating in the world.

I see the hubristic human beings
Attempt to build another Babel Tower.
I witness the flagrant thing 
Packed into the fragrant box.

How lucky to be a spectator
Sober enough to stay aloof. 
But eventually in the crowd,
I recognize my callous face.
