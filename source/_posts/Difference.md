*by 袁媛*

I lie down
A forefinger pointing at the distance
Standing with my hands on my hips
Firm eyes
Loud voice
I am a leader of others
Oh, it´s a happy happy dream.
I get up
Bearing horrible threat and ugly abuse
Bending down again and again hopelessly
The sun hits
Sweat drops
I am a slavor of others
Oh, its´s a sad sad life.
