*by 倪幸竹*

If there is a time machine,
I would like to go back to stay with my grandma. 
Basking in the sun in winter,
Smelling the flowers in spring,
Eating the sweet watermelons in summer,
Talking about my stories with her in autumn,
I would like to do everything I could do with her.

If there is a time machine,
I would like to go back to the past.
To see her warm smile, touch her big hands and stay in her arms.
Her smile is the sunshine in winter,
It’s the cool wind in summer.
I can’t touch it,
But I can feel it.

If there is a time machine,
I would like to feel the warm sunshine,
To feel the cool winter, again,
However, there is no such a kind of machine.
Oh, my grandma, if you can hear me,
Can you come to my dream?
Your smile can be my best dream since the day you left.
