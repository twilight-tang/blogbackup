*by 代君*

Till the ocean swallow the sky
shall friendship, between you and I
makes tear ran out of your eye
inside your mind lies a beam of light
guiding the hope towards the outside
we all looking for a better life
to live

you are the song and sunset
beautiful and sad 
like moon 
pure and bright
every time I could’t sleep at night
it is your smile
looming in my mind
